# Contributing to Smart Scale Game

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Smart Scale Game! This project is an educational tool for teaching corporate entrepreneurship, and we welcome contributions that enhance its pedagogical value.

This is an open-source project — you're encouraged to fork, adapt, and extend it for your own purposes under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

## Ways to Contribute

### Report Issues
Found a bug or something that doesn't work as expected? Please [open an issue](../../issues) with:
- A clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Your browser and device information
- Screenshots if helpful

### Suggest Improvements
Have ideas for new events, game mechanics, or educational features? We'd love to hear them. Please open an issue tagged as "enhancement" and describe:
- What you'd like to see added or changed
- Why this would improve the learning experience
- Any examples or references that inspired the idea

### Submit New Events
The game's strength comes from its variety of decision events. If you'd like to contribute new events:

1. Events should present realistic corporate venture dilemmas
2. Options should represent genuine trade-offs (no obviously "right" answer)
3. Effects should be balanced and consistent with game mechanics
4. Include a brief rationale connecting to corporate entrepreneurship concepts

### Translations
We welcome translations to make the game accessible to more learners. To create a translation:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your language (e.g., `translation/spanish`)
3. Translate all user-facing text strings
4. Test thoroughly to ensure text fits UI elements
5. Submit a pull request with your translation

## Code Contributions

The game is a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript. If you'd like to contribute code:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
5. Test on mobile devices
6. Submit a pull request with a clear description of changes

### Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused and reasonably sized
- Maintain the single-file structure
