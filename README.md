# Smart Scale Game

**A business simulation for teaching corporate venture scaling**

A browser-based game where students run a corporate venture inside a large company, making decisions about replication strategy, knowledge transfer, and growth. Designed to surface the tensions between template fidelity and local adaptation, speed and quality, headquarters control and field autonomy. Runs 30–45 minutes. No installation required.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

The game immerses players in the distinctive challenges of running an internal corporate venture — a context that differs significantly from both traditional management and independent startups.

### Decision-Making Under Uncertainty
Players face ambiguous situations where the "right" answer isn't clear. Every decision involves trade-offs between short-term results and long-term capability building, between speed and quality, between growth and sustainability. The game develops comfort with making consequential decisions based on incomplete information.

### Balancing Local and Global Needs
Corporate ventures must serve multiple masters: the immediate needs of customers and local markets, while also meeting the strategic objectives of the parent corporation. Players learn to navigate tensions between adapting to local conditions and maintaining consistency for scale.

### Building Scalable Solutions
Growing a venture isn't just about acquiring more customers — it requires building products, processes, and organisational capabilities that can expand without breaking. Players discover what it takes to create solutions that work not just in one market, but across many.

### Managing Corporate-Venture Tensions
Internal ventures operate in a unique space: they need the agility of a startup but exist within a large corporate structure. Players experience the push-pull between corporate oversight and venture autonomy, learning to manage upward to HQ while driving results on the ground.

### Understanding the Limits to Scaling
Not every market is right for expansion. Players encounter regulatory barriers, cultural misfits, quality decline at distance, and the tensions between headquarters and field operations — learning that sustainable growth requires knowing when to adapt and when to pull back.

### Resource Allocation and Prioritisation
With limited budgets and competing demands from multiple departments, players must make difficult choices about where to invest. The game surfaces the real trade-offs between investing in marketing vs. operations vs. technology vs. people.

*The specific strategic lessons emerge through gameplay and are best explored during facilitated debrief sessions after play.*
